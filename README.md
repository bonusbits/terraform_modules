# Purpose
Various Terraform Modules, configurations and tfvar examples. Rake tasks are used from the root directory to simplify usage of the project. Mostly this project is a good central location for real-world Terraform references, but very functional as well.

## Notes
 * The project is still under heavy construction, but the vpc and include_vpc/ec2_asg_web environments work. 
 * The asg_cf can have issues if the CloudFormation doesn't launch right the first time. Simply delete the CF Stack in AWS Console as a workaround. Eventually I figure out how to replicate the logic in the small CloudFormation Template into Terraform Code. Just needed a starting point for now.

# Usage
Rake tasks have been setup to make the usage easier for developers and for use with a CI.

## Prerequisites
* Terraform (0.12.18+)
* Ruby (2.6.5) - Included in ChefDK (4.5.0)
* Rake (12.3.2) - Included in ChefDK (4.5.0)

## Create Project Var Yaml
Create or pick an example project variable file in the **vars** directory. This is used by rake tasks to operate against our project and environment.

#### Tips
* TF_WORKSPACE env var value must equal the filename of the ```vars/*.yml```
* Filename has to be all lowercase and snake case.

| Variables | Example | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| tf_root_path | environments/include_vpc/ec2_asg_web | Where the main.tf, outputs.tf and variables.tf files are that pick which modules to use.
| tf_var_file | environments/include_vpc/ec2_asg_web/dev.tfvars | Specific Terraform variables that are fed to modules.

## Set Environment Variables
1. ```TF_WORKSPACE``` (Required) to the filename of the project variables yaml ```vars/*.yml```<br>
    ```bash
    # ./vars/vpc_dev.yml
    export TF_WORKSPACE="vpc_dev"
    ```
**OR**
```bash
TF_WORKSPACE="vpc_dev" rake deploy:tf
```


## List Rake Tasks
```bash
rake -T
```

## Deploy Preparations - Init & Plan (Optional)
```bash
rake deploy:tf_prep
```
**OR**
```bash
rake tfp
```

## Deploy Environment
```bash
rake deploy:tf
```
**OR**
```bash
rake dtf
```

## Undeploy Environment
```bash
rake undeploy:tf
```
**OR**
```bash
rake utf
```
